##### Tips for good design
A good place to start when thinking about a good design for your tests is with Kent Beck's four rules of simple design:

1. Tests pass - as in unit tests pass where ever applicable (In case of Automation Framework)
2. Express intent - your code should be clear and legible
3. Remove Duplication
4. Keep it small

Because we are writing tests, it's also a good idea to keep his [test desiderata](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-desiderata-94150638a4b3) in mind.
